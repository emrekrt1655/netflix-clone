I aimed in this project to improve myself in pure JavaScript and CSS3. I have used fetch method to make request to TMDB API. I have coded some functions to make different types of categories and detailed information of the movies. I tried to make similar with Netflix. I have deployed to HerOku. You can reach the website in the environments parts.
